# Michael's Webmaster Project

I made various changes to the website to display my capabilities as a Web Master.

## Finished:

Nothing yet!
All changes can be found in the "Michael's Changes" Section of Info. 

## To-Do List:

Figure out how to deploy myself (Shouldn’t be hard, use github pages or webstorm)
Fix “Get Tutored” button (super easy)
Add “Get Tutored” button to login version (super easy)
Create a “Michael’s changes” page and add it to the info dropdown (not hard)
Let people choose their time & hour for “Get Tutored” to reduce amount that has to be pulled (IDK how hard)
Let members describe themselves when setting tutoring hours.
