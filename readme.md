# Michael's Webmaster Project

I made various changes to the website to display my capabilities as a Web Master.

## Finished:
Create a "Changelog" Page.

Fix “Get Tutored” button 
Add “Get Tutored” button to login version of site (both demonstrating my ability to recognize problems and address them)

Added a "Feedback" page to the site, accessed through the Nav Bar 
(demonstrating my ability to use the router, navbar, and google form integration)
(Feedback was an important part of my position paper and should be a big part of my time as Webmaster)

Used vuex-persist to store user login data between sessions using cookies and local storage. (untested) (demonstrating my ability to use plugins and add new quality-of-life features.)
(The vuex-persist code is fully explained as well.)
(If for some reason the vuex-persist code causes the page to not work, you can comment it out in store.js and just see my other changes.)

## To-Do List:

Let people choose their time & hour for “Get Tutored” to reduce amount that has to be pulled.
Let members describe themselves when setting tutoring hours. 
(I would love to do these, but don't feel comfortable changing the Tutoring pages without being able to view them.)
