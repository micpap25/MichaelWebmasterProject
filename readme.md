## Finished:

Fix “Get Tutored” button 
Add “Get Tutored” button to login version
Use vuex-persist to store user login data between sessions using cookies and local storage. (untested) 

## To-Do List:

Figure out how test logging in on a client.
Create a "Yearbook" Page.
Create a "Changelog" Page.
Let people choose their time & hour for “Get Tutored” to reduce amount that has to be pulled.
Let members describe themselves when setting tutoring hours. 
Figure out how to deploy myself
